MONTE CARLO SIMULATION REPORT
Celestial Navigation Progressive Strategy for Military Vehicles
======================================================================

DATE: 2025-11-16 21:36:43
Total Trials: 6000
Catalog Size: 535 stars
Match Tolerance: 15.0 arcsec
Overall Success Rate: 98.4%

======================================================================
ALGORITHM LOGIC SUMMARY
======================================================================
The progressive strategy relies on three algorithms with increasing robustness and computational cost:

1. LIEBE'S TRIANGLE ALGORITHM (Fastest - Primary Method):
   - Logic: Identifies the three brightest stars and uses the shortest angular distance for a quick index lookup.
   - Verification: Match requires at least two distinct catalog pairs to share the shortest distance (Simulated quick match).

2. GEOMETRIC VOTING ALGORITHM (Moderate - Fallback 1):
   - Logic: Calculates all inter-star distances in the observed field. Each distance generates 'votes' for catalog star pairs that share that distance.
   - Verification: Must exceed a 75% cumulative vote threshold AND pass a pattern consistency check between the top N candidate stars (Simulated geometric check).

3. PYRAMID ALGORITHM (Most Robust - Fallback 2):
   - Logic: Requires 4 stars. Uses the 4 shortest distances (legs) for highly redundant, search-less lookups against the index.
   - Verification: Requires a high number of index hits and at least 4 unique candidate star IDs (Simulated high-redundancy check).

KEY OPERATIONAL FINDINGS
======================================================================

1. Overall System Reliability: 98.4% success rate across 6000 trials.

2. Progressive Strategy Efficacy:
   - Primary Solver (Liebe) solved 98.4% of all trials.
   - Fallback System (Voting + Pyramid) contributed 0.0% additional coverage.
   - The fallback system increased overall success by 0.0% over using Liebe alone.

3. Environmental Degradation:
   - Best Case (Clear_Rural_Base): Performance at 100.0% success.
   - Worst Case (Forest_Canopy_Obscured): Performance drops to 95.3% success.
   - High Noise (e.g., Dust Storm) primarily triggers the Geometric Voting algorithm due to its inherent resilience to positional jitter.
   - Low Star Count (e.g., Forest Canopy) results in the highest failure rate, as Voting and Pyramid require a sufficient number of features.
